# Automatisiertes_Fahrzeug_ACC_ADAS

During the project "ACC simulation of L2 autonomous driving", which is based on a simulator called "Tronis" from UE4, I achieve the basic lane detection with the internal camera sensor based on OpenCV, and calculate the appropriate steering angle to control the vehicle steering. Using PID controller to
maintain the speed and the distance towards the vehicles in front with several position sensor and speed sensor. Combining them together to achieve a simple L2 autonomous driving. Furthermore I did an improvement for lane detection assistance when facing lanes in different colors during road construction in real life.
